-------------------------------

I created this repository for playing around with small changes and added yaml
descriptions for easy integration into the nbextensions config utility provided

##[Calico](http://calicoproject.org/)
The Calico Project is a framework for learning, doing, and playing
with computation. At its core is an integrated editor, interactive
console, and social interaction framework for exploring computer
science through modern, dynamic languages. It is designed to be a
simple, yet powerful, integrated development environment (IDE) for
students, teachers, researchers---and regular humans, too! It runs on
most any operating system, including Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. All
sources for the Calico Project are open and free---freely available
and you are free to use them in various ways.
